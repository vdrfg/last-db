As a big fan of rateyourmusic.com and last.fm I have decided to make a personal project based on those two website. The goal is to make a "database" of artists and albums that can be rated and through last.fm API, users could also see how much they are listening to each artist, album or song.

That is quite a huge task for someone who started programming just last year so it will take a lot of time probably.

These are my tasks for the near future:
1. Create a basic database structure for artists, albums and songs.
2. Create endpoints for viewing and editing artists etc.
3. Add users and their authorities
4. Add "scrobbles"
   - via csv file upload
   - via last.fm API
5. Add some cool graphs and whatnot
6. Maybe play with musicbrainz.com API as well...
