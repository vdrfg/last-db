As a big fan of rateyourmusic.com and last.fm I have decided to make a personal project based on those two website. The goal is to make a "database" of artists and albums that can be rated and through last.fm API, users could also see how much they are listening to each artist, album or song.

That is quite a huge task for someone who started programming just last year so it will take a lot of time probably.
